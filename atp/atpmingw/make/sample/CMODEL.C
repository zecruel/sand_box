 /* Remarks:
 |   xin_ar  holds input values received from the calling model.
 |   xout_ar holds output values sent back to the calling model.
 |   xvar_ar holds state values stored in memory by MODELS between calls.
 |
 |   Note how xvar_ar is referenced before a new value is assigned to it,
 |    requiring a reference to the pre-simulation history of xvar_ar
 |    at the first execution of the procedure.
 |
 |   Note that you need to modify ATP file fgnmod.for in order to connect
 |   additional user-defined foreign subroutines and procedures.
